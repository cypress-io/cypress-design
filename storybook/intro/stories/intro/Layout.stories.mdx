# Terminology

## Test

A test is an `it()` statement that contains one or more [assertions](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Assertions). e.g.

```js
it('Visits the Kitchen Sink', () => {
  cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')
})
```

## Spec

A spec or spec file is a file that contains one or more tests. The file name might be something like `sample_spec.js` or `Sample.spec.tsx`.

## Run

In the context of the dashboard, a run consists of all the test results that were recorded during a specific recording. Recordings occur by passing the [record key](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/dashboard/projects#Record-key) when running Cypress tests on your computer or in CI.

Each run has one and only one of the following statuses: RUNNING, ERRORED, FAILED, TIMEDOUT, NOTESTS, PASSED, OVERLIMIT, or CANCELLED.

## Test result

A test result is the recording of a specific test on a specific run.

Each test result has one and only one of the following [statuses](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-statuses): RUNNING, PENDING, SKIPPED, FAILED, PASSED, TIMEDOUT, ERRORED, or CANCELLED.

Additionally, test results may be [flaky](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/dashboard/flaky-test-management#Flake-Detection), if retries are enabled.
