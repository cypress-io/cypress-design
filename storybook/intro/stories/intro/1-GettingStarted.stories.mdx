**Cypress Design System** is an open source tool for building webapps, websites and electron applications with the Cypress branding and design. 
It provides a set of organized components, patterns & practices that work as the foundation for our application development.

ðŸš§ It is and will stay a work in progress. ðŸš§

The Design Engineering team will answer and prioritize it as fast as we can.

You can also [open a Pull Request](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-design/compare) without asking for permission.
We will review it as a priority.

All design system packages are published to the `@cypress-design` npm organization/registry. 

## Installing CSS

Every component is styled using a utility first CSS framework: WindiCSS.
Install it in your project to render them properly.

First, install the CSS package in your dev dependencies:

```
yarn add -D @cypress-design/css
```

Then add the plugin to your bundler configuration:

### Webpack

```js
const { CyCSSWebpackPlugin } = require('@cypress-design/css');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    CyCSSWebpackPlugin({
      scan: {
        include: [
          'src/**/*.@(tsx|ts|js|vue)',
        ],
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

### Vite

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { CyCSSVitePlugin } from '@cypress-design/css'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    CyCSSVitePlugin({
      scan: {
        include: ['/src/**/*.@(tsx|ts|js|vue)'],
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

> **NOTE**: Add your html page and all your react and vue component files to the `scan.include` array. 
> This helps WindiCSS determine which class to include in the final generated CSS.


## components

Each component is its own package.
