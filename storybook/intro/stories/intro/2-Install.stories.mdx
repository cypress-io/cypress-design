## Components Packages

Each component is its own package. 

To install the button component in a react project, run the following command:

```
yarn add @cypress-design/react-button --save
```

Each component is versionned separately so if we need an urgent fix, we don't get blocked by non-working other components and we can deliver.

## Install CSS Utility

Every component is styled using a utility first CSS framework: WindiCSS.
Install it in your project to render the components properly.

To do that, follow the two steps below:

1. Install the CSS package in your dev dependencies:

```
yarn add -D @cypress-design/css
```

2. Add the plugin to your bundler configuration:

### Webpack

```js
const { CyCSSWebpackPlugin } = require('@cypress-design/css');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    CyCSSWebpackPlugin({
      scan: {
        include: [
          'src/**/*.@(tsx|ts|js|vue)',
        ],
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

### Vite

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { CyCSSVitePlugin } from '@cypress-design/css'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    CyCSSVitePlugin({
      scan: {
        include: ['/src/**/*.@(tsx|ts|js|vue)'],
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

> **NOTE**: Add your html page and all your react and vue component files to the `scan.include` array. 
> This helps WindiCSS determine which class to include in the final generated CSS.
