# Elements of the Cypress Design System

---

#### Design System

Common dictionary definition:

de•sign sys•tem: a set of rules that define how a product looks and works based on brand guidelines.

More broadly it is a "system" in the sense of:

- a "system of collaboration" (assisting handoff and precision among designers, developers, product managers, etc.)
- a "system of components" that work together
- a "systematic" workflow (holistic, repeatable process)

More specifically Cypress design system contains:

- **Components in Code** that are pre-built to design system standards (eg. with accessibility review.)
- **Designs in Figma** that specify the behavior of components organized by initiative or location in the app.
- **Guidelines that clarify patterns of use** such as this site!

## The new design system: cypress-design

_This is main place to see our core components, in code._

Used by Website, App, Cloud, and Documentation

- Has both Vue and React components
- Well-specified in Figma
- Uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/ 'https://tailwindcss.com/')

## Components defined in Figma

_The main reference for how we want the components to look._

## Cloud-design Storybook

- Legacy cloud-design Storybook: [cloud-design.cypress.io](https://cloud-design.cypress.io/ 'https://cloud-design.cypress.io/')
- Uses legacy Bootstrap 3 with SCSS

⚠️ Cloud-design is overall stable, but not clearly specified in in Figma.
