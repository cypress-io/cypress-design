![](./.vitepress/theme/components/meadow-logo.png)

The Cypress design system is the whole system of:

- **Figma files** that specify the behavior of components organized by initiative or location in the app.
- **Design tokens** (a special type of variables) that specify font size, line height, color, etc.
- **Components** that are pre-built to design system standards (eg. with accessibility review.)
- **Documentation** This site!

## The new design system: cypress-design

_This is main place to see our core components, in code._

Used by Website, App, Cloud, and Documentation

- Has both Vue and React components
- Well-specified in Figma
- Uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/ 'https://tailwindcss.com/')

## Components defined in Figma
