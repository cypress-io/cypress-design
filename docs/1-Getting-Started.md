# Cypress Design System

---

The Cypress design system is the system of:

- **This documentation site** with stories that document the behavior of components.
- **Figma files** that specify the behavior of components organized by initiative or location in the app.
- **Design tokens** (a special type of variables) that specify font size, line height, color, etc.
- **Components** that are pre-built to design system standards (eg. with accessibility review.)

Use the navigation to browse specific components and guides.

Feedback welcome! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-design).
